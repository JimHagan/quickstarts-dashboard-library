## Quickstarts Dashboard library

The Quickstarts Dashboard library is a collection of dashboards for use in the New Relic platform. This library is used as a source for the [`nr1-quickstarts` nerdlet](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-quickstarts) available in the New Relic platform. This library is community sourced and open to contribution, so if you have some great dashboards to share follow the manual below.

## Getting Started

Do you have some great dashboards to share? Follow the steps below to add them to the library.

1. [Fork the Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)

2. [Clone your own repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

3. Copy the directory `library/_template` and it's content to a new directory within the `library` folder. Choose a name which identifies the main purpose of your quickstart, for example: `rabbitmq`, `apm-errors`, ...

4. Add your dashboards in the `library/[your dir]/dashboards` folder. To export your dashboard you can use the [`nr1-quickstarts` nerdlet](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-quickstarts) available in New Relic. There's a "export helper" link in the sidebar.

Optionally you can add multiple screenshots per dashboard as long as they have the same name as your dashboard file. For example `rabbitmq.json` `rabbitmq.png` `rabbitmq.jpeg`. You can add multiple screenshots by putting a number after the filename, for example `rabbitmq01.png`, `rabbitmq02.png`.

5. Edit the `quickstarts/[your dir]/config.yaml` file with your values.

6. Commit your changes `git add -A` and `git commit -m "Added [name]"`. Change the `[name]` with a description of the dashboard you've added.

7. Push your changes to Github `git push`

8. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in the [parent repository](https://github.com/newrelic/quickstarts-dashboard-library/compare?expand=1).

9. Submit and wait for review. We will review as fast as we can, but it can sometimes take a day or two.

Thanks a lot for your submission!
